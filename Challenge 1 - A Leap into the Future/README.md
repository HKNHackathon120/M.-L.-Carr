# Challenge One: A Leap into the Future

## Overview

This challenge requires the participants to create a down counter on a 7 segment display which has a START date of 10.28.2024 (October 28th, 2024) and counts down to an END date of 10.28.1906 (October 28th, 1906).

## Knowledge

- Logic gates

## Files provided

- [Multisim counter explanation: Counter with 7-Segment Display - Multisim Live](https://www.multisim.com/content/DP6MYrVch3hwtDWamfmggg/counter-with-7-segment-display/)

## Documentation

Here's how you could procede:
- create a state table
- derive logic
- create circuit schematic
- run Simulation

## Evaluation Criteria

The solution will be evaluated base on the following criteria:
 - methodology: was the task created in an innovative and creative way? (working solution, minimal redundant logic, etc)
- working solution: was the task executed successfully or were there unknown bugs/glitches?
